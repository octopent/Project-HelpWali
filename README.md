Project HelpWali is a small attempt to liberate the hardworking maids of the helping industry in
our locality and help them get their rightful share of money and respect. It also extends to help
cooks, drivers, servants, and gardeners etc. who play a crucially important role in the society.
We seek to create an online venture comprising maids, baby-sitters, nurses and drivers and so on.
This online portal may be accessed by means of an android app which may be further used for
maid booking and payments if intended. It may also divide the helpwalis in different categories
for easy search and look-up by the viewers or the users of the app.
As a solution to the anarchy in the helping industry, not only will it provide orderliness but at the
same time, it will also connect the supply to the demand and remove the concept of middle men.

The HelpWali Portal will provide a connection mechanism to all the helpwalis in the area and will
also provide standardization and regularity in the salaries paid to them. The online venture may
also serve as an easy means to find and book helpwalis online through the HelpWali app depending
on the need of the user.

Adding on, the portal may also serve as a store for information of both the maid and the client in
case of any unwary situation. Security comes as a side effect of the process and we can very well
determine which worker is working in which house and which part of the city. Since every
transaction will be recorded, there will be no cases of discrepancies and fraud.
Lastly, Project HelpWali might also be a step towards our Hon’ble Prime Minister’s idea of Digital
India.
